Jupyter/Python project. Cleaning and preparing used cars ads dataset for clustering and price tracking. 

## Why?
The goal of this project was to track the price of used car ads on the web in 2020/2021, to see and understand possible patterns.

## Data
A dataset of almost 30k ads was previously scraped from the web

## Preparation
The dataset was claned, transformed and prepared for clustering. For feature selection, a supervised method based on correlation (with price) was adopted.

## Clustering
Using k-modes, it was possible to obtain clusters and to analyze the price over the chosen time period.
